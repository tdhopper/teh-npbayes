Some simple data sets to play with.


datass = gengaussian(numdim,numgroup,nummu,numdata,alpha,musigma,sigma);
	Generates multiple groups of data items, each group being a mixture
	of Gaussians.  The Gaussians are shared across groups, with each
	group having different mixing proportions.  Spherical Gaussians
	each of same standard deviation.
numdim    dimensionality of the data.
numgroup  number of groups.
nummu     number of Gaussians.
numdata   number of data items per group.
alpha     concentration parameter for the mixing proportions of each group.
musigma   standard deviation of the mean of the Gaussians.
sigma     standard deviation of each Gaussian.


datass = genbars(imsize,noiselevel,numbarpermix,numgroup,numdata);
	Generate bars.  Each group can be seen as an image with multiple 
	bars in it (either horizontal or vertical), with the pixel value 
	of each pixel being the number of data items with that value.
imsize        size of image.
noiselevel    amount of noise (noiselevel/(1+noiselvel) is actual 
              proportion of noise).
numbarpermix  probabilities of generating a particular number of bars.
numgroup      number of groups (images).
numdata       number of data items drawn from each group.
