This code base is for people interested in trying out various
nonparametric Bayesian models on some simple data sets.  

It is implemented in MATLAB so by definition cannot be very efficient.
This is because it is for people to muck around with and experiment.
That said, the code is reasonably efficient.  I have run it on document
corpora of half a million to a million words.

The code is reasonably modular and documented by README files in each
section.  As I get time I will release more documentation (just little
technical notes) and more code.

I have implemented LDA, HDP mixtures, and DP mixtures, using a variety
of sampling schemes, including Chinese restaurant process/franchise, Beta
auxiliary variable method (both in HDP tech report), and a range limiting
blocked Gibbs sampler (not yet published) especially for multinomials
(to take advantage of vectorization in matlab).  

Each mixture model can use a variety of types of components.  Currently
I only have Gaussians and multinomials, both with conjugate priors.
Stay tuned.


Implementations
===============
hdpmix		Hierarchical Dirichlet process mixtures.
		Uses CRF, beta auxiliary variables, and range limiting
		blocked Gibbs (only for multinomials)

lda		Latent Dirichlet allocation.
		Uses CRP, beta auxiliary variables, and blocked Gibbs
		(only for multinomials).

dpmix		Dirichlet process mixtures.  
		Uses CRP, beta auxiliary variables, and k-means.


Pre-made Mixtures
=================
dpGaussianWishart
	DP mixture of Gaussians with Gaussian-Wishart prior.

hdpMultinoimal
	HDP mixture of multinomials with Dirichlet prior.

ldaMultinomial
	LDA.


Tests/Demos
===========
testbars
	Demonstrates HDP mixture and LDA trained on bars problem.

testdpmixGaussianWishart
	Demonstrates DP mixture trained on an actual mixture of Gaussians.

testpredict
	Tests the estimated predictive likelihood given by HDP/LDA.

testrandconparam
