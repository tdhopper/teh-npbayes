Sampling Utilities
==================
randmult(pp,normdim)
        Generates multinomial samples with mixing proportions given in pp, 
	where normdim gives the dimension over which pp sums to 1 and defines 
	a multinomial distribution.  pp need not be normalized.  If normdim
	is not given it is the first nonzero dimension.

randdir(aa,normdim)
        Generates Dirichlet samples, with weights given in aa.  The output
	sums to 1 along normdim, and each such sum corresponds to one 
	Dirichlet sample.

randbeta(aa,bb)
	Generates beta samples, with weights given by aa and bb.

randgamma(aa)
	Generates gamma samples, with shape given in aa, and scale 1.


DP Sampling Utilities
=====================
randconparam(alpha,numdata,numclass,aa,bb,numiter)
	Generates a sample from a concentration parameter with gamma(aa,bb)
	prior, and number of classes and data items given in numdata, numclass
	(has to be row vectors).  Uses auxiliary variable method, for numiter
	iterations.

randnumtable(weights,maxtable)
	For each entry in weights and maxtables, generates the number of 
	tables given concentration parameter (weights) and number of data 
	items (maxtable).

randstick(alpha,numclass)
	Generates stick-breaking weights with concentration parameter for
	numclass "sticks".

[cc numclass] = randcrp(alpha,numdata)
	Generates a partition of numdata items with concentration parameter
	alpha.  cc is sequence of indicator variables denoting which class
	each data item is in, and numclass is the generated number of classes.


Other DP Utilities
==================
[ss lmss] = stirling(nn)
	Gives Stirling numbers s(nn,*) in ss.  ss(i) = s(nn,i-1).  ss is 
	normalized so that maximum value is 1, and the log of normalization
	is returned in lmss.

enumclass(alpha,numdata)
	The expected number of tables in a CRP with concentration parameter
	alpha and numdata items.

meanlik(lik)
	Computes estimated likelihood from individual samples.  Basically does
	a harmonic mean of lik in 3rd dimension, followed by normal mean in 2nd.

logmeanexp(ww,normdim)
	computes log(mean(exp(ww),normdim)).

Graphical Utilities
===================
imlayout(w,shape,s,...)
	Shows a montage of images, with each image of size given by first two
	entries in shape, and the layout of images (#rows, #columns) given by
	third and fourth entry in shape.  s is a scale such that s(1) is black,
	s(2) is white.  Images given in w, which doesn't have to be in the
	right shape (inlayout will use reshape to shape w correctly).  Lines
	at boundary separating images, and arguments after s are passed
	to plot to draw these lines.

plotellipse(xx,var,style)
        Plots a 2D Gaussian at 1 STD, with mean xx, covariance var, and given
	line style (passed to plot).

mysubplot(i,j,k,m)
	Like subplot, except you get control over how much border you put
	around each subplot (minimize space wastage).  Also means top .05
	of figure blank so title will fit it and not get chopped at top.
