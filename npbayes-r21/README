This release #2 is a totally new code base and has little to do with
the previous release.  Release #2.1 is updated to fix some bugs that
were present in release #2.

This package implements hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP)
mixture models.  It handles the general case where the Dirichlet
processes (DPs) can be arranged according to any tree structure, with
observations associated with any DP.  We assume the base distribution is
conjugate to the observation distributions and we integrate out mixture
component parameters.  We have currently only implemented multinomial
observations with Dirichlet base distributions, though this should be
easily generalized to any distribution over observations along with its
conjugate prior.  Check back soon.

It is implemented in matlab and C, with the main engine in C with a
mex interface.  It is much more efficient than the previous release.
The sampling scheme I've included here is the auxiliary variable method.
The code is reasonably modular and documented by README files in each
section.  The code was tested on matlab 6.5 under red hat linux 9.0 and
matlab 7.0 under mac os x.

I have a small demo called testbars which shows that the code works!
Please run make in matlab to compile the mex files.  And everytime you
would like to run the code run initpath first, which simply adds the 
relevant subdirectories into the matlab path.

In the future: other sampling schemes, other likelihood distributions,
a finite version, and the infinite HMM (code is there, need clean up).
